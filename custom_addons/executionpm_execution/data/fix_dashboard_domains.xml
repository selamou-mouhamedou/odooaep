    BOX: "Works Waiting Validation" (PMO Dashboard)
    ========================================================================
    
    BUSINESS DEFINITION:
    - Progress declarations that have been submitted by contractors
    - Currently pending review or being reviewed by PMO/Control Office
    - NOT YET validated by PMO
    
    INCLUDED RECORDS:
    - state = 'submitted' (freshly submitted, awaiting review)
    - state = 'under_review' (PMO is actively reviewing)
    
    EXCLUDED RECORDS:
    - state = 'draft' (not yet submitted by contractor)
    - state = 'validated' (already approved - CRITICAL: must never appear here)
    - state = 'rejected' (already rejected and sent back to contractor)
    
    RATIONALE:
    - 'rejected' records are waiting for CONTRACTOR action, not PMO
    - 'validated' records have completed the validation flow
    - Only 'submitted' and 'under_review' are genuinely "waiting validation"

    BOX: "Tasks Past Planning Deadline" (PMO Dashboard)
    ========================================================================
    
    BUSINESS DEFINITION:
    - Tasks whose planned end date has passed
    - AND actual validated progress is less than 100%
    - Excludes completed tasks (cannot be overdue if finished)
    
    INCLUDED RECORDS:
    - date_end < today (planned deadline passed)
    - actual_progress < 100 (not yet completed)
    - progress_status != 'completed' (redundant safety check)
    - planning is approved (only count tasks from approved plannings)
    
    EXCLUDED RECORDS:
    - Tasks with date_end >= today (deadline not passed)
    - Tasks with actual_progress = 100 (completed on time or late)
    - Tasks with progress_status = 'completed'
    - Tasks from non-approved plannings
    
    RATIONALE:
    - A task is "past deadline" only if it's incomplete after the end date
    - Completed tasks should never show here even if finished late
    - actual_progress is used (not validated_progress) for real-time tracking

    BUSINESS DEFINITION:
    - Work packages (tasks) assigned to the current contractor
    - Currently within execution period (started but not ended)
    - Not yet completed (progress < 100%)
    
    INCLUDED RECORDS:

    - Tasks from non-approved plannings
